# COVID-19-Global-Vaccine-Tracker
What share of the population has been partly or fully vaccinated against COVID-19 ?


Basically in this exercise the purpose is to know exactly the following groups:
1 Partially vaccinated persons
2 Fully vaccinated persons
3 Unvaccinated persons
.

The first thing is to make the connection to the csv data:
Once loaded and analyzed the congruence of the data and the validation of them.
You can proceed to understand the logic behind the data. 
On the one hand we have the category dates, Continents, countries and the category of partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, not vaccinated.

Once the variables have been identified, we must proceed to calculate the KPIs necessary for the dashboard and answer the necessary questions. 
(KPI) 
KPI 1 People Partially vaccinated
KPI 2 People fully vaccinated
KPI 3 Share people not vaccinated 

Graph 1
Vaccinated V/S Fully vaccinated by location
This bar chart seeks to graphically explain in the universe of vaccinated people which have been vaccinated with one dose and which have been fully vaccinated.
As a conclusion of this graph we can infer that in most of the countries people have been vaccinated with one dose. 




graph 2 
Vaccination per Hundred Map
It corresponds to a map graph that allows us to conclude that in a lighter blue color there are less people vaccinated in a scale of 100 people, while the dark blue allows us to conclude that there are more people vaccinated in a rate of 100 people. Later in graph 3 we will understand the correlation that exists in this graph with the per capita income of each country.


Graph 3 
Vaccinated over gdp( Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period)
In this graph we can conclude that the higher the level of gross per capita income, the higher the level of partially or fully vaccinated.



Finally to conclude, it is possible to say that in this case, the information analyzed gives us many answers related to the economic difference and the rate of vaccinated people. This information is important for the economic and governmental organizations of each country to work on diminishing those gaps that have always existed between developed and under developed countries.

Thank you very much.
