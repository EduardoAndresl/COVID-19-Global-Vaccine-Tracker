# COVID-19-Global-Vaccine-Tracker
What share of the population has been partly or fully vaccinated against COVID-19 ?


Basically in this exercise the purpose is to know exactly the following groups:
1 Partially vaccinated persons
2 Fully vaccinated persons
3 Unvaccinated persons
.

<h3> The first thing is to make the connection to the csv data: </h3>

Once the information is loaded we proceed to analyzed the congruence of the data and the validation of them.
With this tou are able to understand the logic behind the data. 
Once we have find the category dates, Continents, countries and the universe of partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, not vaccinated.
we must proceed to calculate the KPIs necessary for the dashboard and answer some questions. 

<h3> The following KPI'S will be used in the analysis of the charts </h3>
<ol>
  <li> KPI 1 People Partially vaccinated. </li>
  <li> KPI 2 People fully vaccinated.  </li>
  <li> KPI 3 Share people not vaccinated. </li>
</ol>

<h3> Graph 1: Vaccinated V/S Fully vaccinated by location </h3>
This bar chart seeks to graphically explain in the universe of vaccinated people which have been vaccinated with one dose and which have been fully vaccinated.
As a conclusion of this graph we can infer that in most of the countries people have been vaccinated with at least one dose.

<h3> Graph 2: Vaccination per Hundred Map </h3> 
It is a map graph that allows us to conclude that in a lighter blue color there are less people vaccinated in a scale of 100 people, while the dark blue allows us to conclude that there are more people vaccinated in a rate of 100 people. Later in graph 3 we will understand the correlation that exists in this graph with the per capita income of each country.

<h3> Graph 3 Vaccinated over GDP  </h3> 
 
Vaccinated over gdp( Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period)
In this graph we can conclude that the higher the level of gross per capita income, the higher the level of partially or fully vaccinated.

<h3> Final Thoughts </h3> 

Finally to conclude, it is possible to say that in this case, the information analyzed gives us many answers related to the economic difference and the rate of vaccinated people. This information is important for the economic and governmental organizations of each country to work on reduce those gaps that have always existed between developed and under developed countries.
